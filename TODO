Model
- Model Iterator support
- find by image_id not just id
- ->not on result doesn't work with image_id or id
- How do isset() and unset() relate to model properties? (what counts as a property that is 'not set')?
- implement Decimal field type
- Doing 'order by' a hasone creates a join and sorts on the display field. Maybe make the sort
  field configurable per-hasone?
- customize escaping (allowed tags?)

Controller
- way for actions to trigger 404s
- before_action and after_action methods should be _before_action and _after_action
  so they aren't callable as actions.

Views
- Have a backing controller for the template (get logic out of page.php)

Forms
- review classnames in regards to checkboxes, radios, selects regarding values, wrappers and labels
- required support for radios, multi-checkboxes

Misc Ideas
- dependency injection / class binding?
    echo Octopus::getBinding('View_Finder');
    > Octopus_View_Finder
    Octopus::bind('View_Finder', 'My_Custom_View_Finder_Class');
    echo Octopus::loadClass('View_Finder')
    > 'My_Custom_View_Finder_Class'
    Octopus::create('View_Finder')
