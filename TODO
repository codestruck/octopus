Model
- when a model has a relationship, should the related model be auto included?
- schema generation from model class
- result set ArrayAccess
- Model ArrayAccess and Iterator
- find by image_id not just id
- ->not on result doesn't work with image_id or id
- How do isset() and unset() relate to model properties? (what counts as a property that is 'not set')?
- Doing 'order by' a hasone creates a join and sorts on the display field. Maybe make the sort
  field configurable per-hasone?

Controller
- way for actions to trigger 404s

Forms
- When upload field is added to a form, automatically set enctype=multipart/form-data
- review classnames in regards to checkboxes, radios, selects regarding values, wrappers and labels
- required support for radios, multi-checkboxes
